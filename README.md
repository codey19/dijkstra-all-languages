# dijkstra-all-languages
A collection of Dijkstra's algorithm implementations in every programming language I know. Current list: Java, C
Basic Structure:
- Node Class:
   - "ID" String/Char Array
   - "Weight" Integer
- Graph Class:
   - "Adjacency List" HashMap (Implement  if needed)
   - Appropriate accompanying methods such as addEdge()
- General Algorithm  Class:
   - Reads in adjacency list data from .txt file
   - Dijkstra Algorithm
